<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
These systems represent an evolving investigation into computation -
from structured arithmetic machinery to stored-program architectures
and adaptive hardware models. Each project explores how organization,
control, and feedback shape increasingly complex behavior.

<h2>Computing Machinery from Scratch</h2>

<p>
A 4-bit arithmetic system built to explore feedback-driven computation.
The machine implements repeated operations, correction logic,
and convergence detection using discrete structural design.
</p>

<p>
This project marked the beginning of a systematic attempt
to understand computation through construction.
</p>

<p>
Later evolved from isolated arithmetic towards program-driven execution. It 
intoduces instruction encoding, control sequencing and memory integration to 
store the machine code program.
</p>

<p>
The focus shifted from individual operations to structured control.

<h2>Assembler</h2>

<p>
A symbolic translation layer designed to convert assembly-level
instructions into machine code for the custom computing architecture.
The assembler automates encoding and instruction mapping 
to eliminate manual lookup.
</p>

<p>
This project represents a shift from structural design
to abstraction management - formalizing the relationship
between symbolic instructions and hardware execution.

<h2>8-bit Breadboard Computer </h2>

<p>
Integrated arithmetic, memory,
and control into a complete discrete system.
The project emphasizes physical implementation
as a path toward architectural intuition.
</p>

<p>
Demonstrated how several modules working synergestically form
a coherent computational system capable of following instructions.

<h2>Gate-Level Perceptron</h2>

<p>
A hardware-level adaptive model exploring
threshold modulation and automated output adjustment
directly within digital circuitry.
</p>

<p>
This project investigates how learning behavior can be embedded
into structured logic without software abstraction.
