<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
These systems represent an evolving investigation into computation —
from structured arithmetic machinery to stored-program architectures
and adaptive hardware models. Each project explores how organization,
control, and feedback shape increasingly complex behavior.

<h2>r_a_m — Repeated Arithmetic Machine</h2>

<p>
A 4-bit arithmetic system built to explore feedback-driven computation.
The machine implements repeated operations, correction logic,
and convergence detection using discrete structural design.
</p>

<p>
This project marked the beginning of a systematic attempt
to understand computation through construction.

<h2>RAMv4 — Stored Program Architecture</h2>

<p>
An evolution from isolated arithmetic toward program-driven execution.
RAMv4 introduces instruction encoding, control sequencing,
and memory integration within a disciplined architectural framework.
</p>

<p>
The focus shifted from individual operations to structured control.

<h2>Python-Based Assembler for RAMv4</h2>

<p>
A symbolic translation layer designed to convert assembly-level
instructions into machine code for the RAMv4 architecture.
The assembler automates encoding, pattern recognition,
and instruction mapping to eliminate manual lookup.
</p>

<p>
This project represents a shift from structural design
to abstraction management — formalizing the relationship
between symbolic instructions and hardware execution.

<h2>Gate-Level Perceptron</h2>

<p>
A hardware-level adaptive model exploring weight storage,
threshold modulation, and automated output adjustment
directly within digital circuitry.
</p>

<p>
This project investigates how learning behavior can be embedded
into structured logic without software abstraction.

<h2>8-bit Breadboard Computer (In Progress)</h2>

<p>
An ongoing effort to integrate arithmetic, memory,
and control into a complete discrete system.
The project emphasizes physical implementation
as a path toward architectural intuition.
