Exploring how logic gates evolve into programmable systems - from raw hardware to machines that guide us to the Moon 🌕

<p>
I explore intelligence, thought, language and machinery through the lens of computation - building
low-level systems, stored-program architectures, and hardware-level learning models.
My work investigates how simple logical components combine to form memory, control, and adaptive behavior.
I am particularly drawn to questions at the boundary of architecture and
intelligence - how physical systems can implement abstraction, adaptation,
and decision-making.

This site is record of that attempt - to understand how structure gives rise to thought.
