I build systems from first principles to understand how structure gives rise to computation, and how computation
gives rise to intelligence.
<p>

<p>
I explore intelligence, thought, language and machinery through the lens of computation investigating
how simple logical components combine to form memory, control and learning. My work moves from
low-level systems and stored-program architectures to hardware-level learning models.
I am drawn to questions at the boundary of structure and
intelligence: how physical systems can implement abstraction, adaptation,
and decision-making.
