I build systems from first principles to understand how structure gives rise to computation.

I explore intelligence, thought, language and machinery through the lens of computation, How simple 
logical components combine to form memory, control and eventually learning - building
low-level systems, stored-program architectures, and hardware-level learning models.
I am drawn to questions at the boundary of structure and
intelligence: how physical systems can implement abstraction, adaptation,
and decision-making.

This site is a record of that attempt - to understand how structure gives rise to computation.
