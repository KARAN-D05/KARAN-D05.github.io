Interested in computation - from its mechanical beginnings to modern AI

   Dovere is my hand, tho small,
     May I not add with truth;
   I do my best to please you all,
     Encourage then my youth.

I am interested in computation as machinery, intelligence and language - how simple logical components
combine to form memory, control, and eventually learning.
</p>

<p>
My work explores computation from the ground up: building low-level computational machines,
stored-program architectures, and hardware-level learning models to understand
how structure gives rise to behavior.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly drawn to questions at the boundary of architecture and
intelligence - how physical systems can implement abstraction, adaptation,
and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
This site is a record of that exploration.
